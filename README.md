# Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology

##  Task 1 Submission: Exploratory Data Analysis on Student Performance Dataset

Welcome to my submission for **Task 1** of the **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**. In this task, I conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **Student Performance Dataset**, aiming to understand key factors that influence student outcomes and academic performance.

---

##  Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about students' performance in **math, reading, and writing**, along with demographic and socio-economic factors such as:

- Gender
- Race/ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type
- Test preparation course

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data handling and preprocessing
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for creating visualizations

---

##  EDA Process

### 1. Data Cleaning:
- Checked and handled **missing values**
- Ensured **data types** were appropriate
- Verified **uniqueness and consistency** in categorical columns

### 2. Data Visualization:
Generated several visualizations to extract insights, including:

-  **Bar Charts** – to compare average scores across gender, parental education, and test preparation
-  **Grouped Plots** – for deeper comparisons (e.g., gender split by test preparation)

---

##  Key Insights

- Students who completed the **test preparation course** scored significantly higher on average.
- **Parental education** level showed a mild correlation with student performance.
- **Gender differences** were observed in some subjects (e.g., higher reading scores among females).
- Strong positive **correlation between reading and writing scores**.
